Inspired by the way that the visual cortex adaptively responds to the type of stimulus, the Stimulus-guided adaptive transformer(SGAT-Net) network is proposed to produce the local-and-global compound features based on inductive bias and self-attention mechanism to take into account the vascular details and anatomy structures.

This repo implementation is based on PyTorch. More details can be found in [Paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.media.2023.102929).
